in Python or so we'll start with basic definition of what a listed will can see how you can create the list will then have accessing of the elements in the list the various operations that can be done on the list and then method and built in functions specifically for list and find even have a short exercise using some of the concepts that we learnt today so what are less a list is a collection of data and this data could be of any data type in fact A list could hold data of different data types as we can see the example down here we have a listen named X and X holds 189 the single letter A the string hey another number zero and capital letter be another important factor with less it indices every element in the list has a position and this position is called it index the first position in a list it is always zero so one is at index 0 89 at index 1 a at index 2 and so on so this means that the position of your last element would be the length of your list -1 so now that you know what a list is let you want to how you can create a list to this my jupyter notebook and will start by creating the most basic list which is an integer list so my list name would be now
